## 📰 NLP News Headlines Analysis (2019–2023)


A comprehensive natural language processing (NLP) project analyzing global news headlines from 2019 to 2023. The focus is on extracting insights from language trends, sentiment patterns, and entity frequencies using classic NLP techniques.
***

# 📌 Project Highlights
✅ Cleaned and normalized thousands of real-world news headlines

✅ Removed stopwords and unified variations of key terms (e.g., "coronavirus" vs. "covid")

✅ Performed tokenization, lemmatization, and POS tagging

✅ Extracted named entities and top keywords

✅ Conducted sentiment analysis over time

✅ Visualized trends using matplotlib and seaborn

## 🔍 Key Features


# 📅 Temporal Sentiment Trends

Sentiment score evolution from 2019 to 2023

Visualized sentiment polarity by month/year and plotted using matplotlib 

# 🗣️ Token Frequency Analysis

Top tokens after removing stopwords

Unified semantically similar tokens (e.g., "covid" + "coronavirus")

#  📈 Sentimental Derivative 

📊 Avg. tokens per headline

Distribution of sentence/token counts

📦 Token frequency bar charts

📉 Sentiment score over time

📊 Box plots of token counts per month

🔠 Named Entity Recognition (NER) counts


More advanced topics such as topic modeling (LDA) and transformer-based models (like DistilBERT) may be added in future iterations.
